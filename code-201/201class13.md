# Class 13 read: Local Storage

1. **_Why would a developer use local storage for a web application?_** - Local storage can be used to save the current state of the website or web application without storing things serverside, meaning the user does not need to log in, simply return using the same device.
2. **_What information should not be stored in local storage?_** - sensitive data should not be stored in localstorage, as it can be viewed in plain text by anyone using the same browser
3. **_Local storage can store what type of data? How would you convert it to that type before storing?_** - localstorage can only store data of type string. In order to convert data to string for storage on eshould use `JSON.stringify()`. To convert it back to its previous state one should use `JSON.parse()`
