# Class 11 Read: Audio, Video, Images

## Video and Audio Content

1. **_Explain how the ability to use video and audio on the web has evolved since the early 2000s._** - Most video content used to be plugins such as flash, but these have been mostly superseded by native HTML video.
2. **_Describe the use of the src and controls attributes in the <video> element._** - The src attribute defines the source of your video file, similar to how the img element works.
3. **_Why is it important to have fallback content inside the <video> element?_** - If the browser in use does not support the video file properly, the fallback content will be displayed instead.

## A Complete Guide To Grid

1. **_How does Grid layout differ from Flex?_** - grid is a much more rigid display, and will always display elements in a precise location relative to the grid. It is easier that flex to align elements horizontally with elements above and below.
2. **_Grid container, grid item, and grid line are a few important terms to understand when using Grid. Please describe these terms in a few sentences._**

- The grid container is the div or sectrion or part of the website that will be defined as a grid
- Grid items are the items within the grid that will be given properties to define their position within the grid.
- The grid lines are the borders of the grid. The lines between the grid boxes.

## Responsive Images

1. **_Besides making a site visually appealing across different screen sizes, why should developers make images responsive?_** - Loading an unnessesarily large image will affect the efficiency of your site.
2. **_Define the following <img> attributes srcset and sizes. Write an example of how they are used._**

- srcset is a list of potential sources for the image, usually similar images in different resolutions or aspect ratios.
- sizes gives the browser instructions on what images to use from the source set depending on some rules. For example one rule could be written as max-width: 500px to target any browsers below this width.

3. **_How is srcset more helpful for responsive images than CSS or JavaScript?_** - The images load before the CSS and JS, meaning the images pulled from srcset will load immediately without CSS or JS being consulted. This avoids situations like images loading twice.
