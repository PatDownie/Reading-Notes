# Object-Oriented Programming, HTML Tables

## Domain Modeling

1. **_Explain why we need domain modeling._** - Domain modelling is required to understand and communicate the problem that the application is intended to solve.

## HTML Table Basics

1. **_Why should tables not be used for page layouts?_**

- A screen reader's output will be confused
- Tables are not responsive unless altered in a specific way.

2. **_List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML <table>._**

- `<td>` means table data and defines a normal table cell
- `<th>` means table header and defines a different type of cell used for headers (such as when specifying a datatype)
- `<colgroup>` and `<col>` allow us to target a certain column or columns for styling etc

## Introducing Constructors

1. **_What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?_** A constructor is a function that creates an object based on a predefined blueprint. It is much easier than manually creating every object literally.
2. **_How does the term `this` differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?_** When using `this` in an object literal, it refers to the object defined in the object literal, however when used in a constructor it refers to instance the object that will be created when the function is called.

## Object Prototypes Using A Constructor

1. **_Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience. _**
