## Flexbox

1. **_Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means._** One dimensional content is content that is all lined up on one line. Flexbox can control item alignment in one dimension but not two (Thi is where display:grid is useful)
2. **_Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis._** - The main axis is the primary direction of flexing (associated with `justify`) and the secondary axis is another axis perpendicular to this (associated with `align`)
3. **_How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?_** - If elements are reordered visually using flex but not reordered in the HTML, a screen reader or similar accessability tool will not be able to accurately glean the desired element order.

## Flexbox 2

1. **_What are some advantages of using flexbox over float?_**

- float cannot vertically align items
- float was not designed for generally arranging elements, so using it to do so is quite unwieldy

2. **_How does this topic connect with your long term goals?_** - Flexbox is powerful and useful in arranging website elements. It can be helpful in making your page attractive, dynamic, and responsive.
