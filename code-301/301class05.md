# Class 05 read: Putting it all together

## Thinking in React

1. **_What is the single responsibility principle and how does it apply to components?_** - One component should do one thing. This is so components can be used modularly and mixed and matched.
2. **_What does it mean to build a ‘static’ version of your application?_** - A static version of a React app displays only static data with no interactivity, just to establish the structure of the app.
3. **_Once you have a static application, what do you need to add?_**
4. **_What are the three questions you can ask to determine if something is state?_**
5. **_How can you identify where state needs to live?_**

## Higher-Order Functions

1. **_What is a “higher-order function”?_**
2. **_Explore the greaterThan function as defined in the reading. In your own words, what is line 2 of this function doing?_**
3. **_Explain how either map or reduce operates, with regards to higher-order functions._**
