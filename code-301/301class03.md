# Class 03 read: Passing Functions as Props

## Lists and keys

1. **_What does .map() return?_** - `.map()` returns a new array with values based on the result of a function that takes each value of the array as an argument.
2. **_If I want to loop through an array and display each value in JSX, how do I do that in React?_** - You could do: `const JSX = Array.map((value) => <p>{value}</p>);` for example.
3. **_Each list item needs a unique \_\_\_\_._** - key attribute
4. **_What is the purpose of a key?_** - It gives each element a stable identity which can be tracked.

## The Spread Operator

1. **_What is the spread operator?_** - The spread operator "spreads" an array into seperate arguments.
2. **_List 4 things that the spread operator can do._**

- Copy an array
- Combine multiple arrays
- Adding to state in React
- Combining objects

3. **_Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two arrays._**

- `const array1 = [1,2,3];`
- `const array2 = [4,5,6];`
- `const combinedArray = [...array1,...array2]`

4. **_Give an example of using the spread operator to add a new item to an array._**

- `const array1 = [1,2,3];`
- `const newArray = [...array1, 4]`

5. **_Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two objects into one._**

- `const object1 = {one: 1, two: 2};`
- `const object2 = {three: 3, four: 4};`
- `const combinedObject = {...object1, ...object2};`
