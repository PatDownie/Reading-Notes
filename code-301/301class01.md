# Class 01 read: Introduction to React and Components

## Component-Based Architecture

1. **_What is a “component”?_** - A component is a self contained piece of code encapsulating a certain functionality that can be exported to be used as part of a wider program.
2. **_What are the characteristics of a component?_**

- Reusable
- Replaceable
- Non context specific
- Extensible (Can be expanded upon to provide new behaviors)
- Encapsulated (Interfaces cleanly with outside components without revealing innner workings)
- Independent (minimal dependencies on other components)

3. **_What are the advantages of using component-based architecture?_** - The modular nature of a component based program means that components can be altered and swapped out independant of one another and the code is neatly separated into self contained elements.

## What is Props and How to Use it in React

1. **_What is “props” short for?_** - Props is short for properties
2. **_How are props used in React?_** - Props are used to pass data from a parent to a child component
3. **_What is the flow of props?_** - Props can only flow "downwards" through the structure, from parent to child. Never up or across.
