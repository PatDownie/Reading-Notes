# Class 04 read: React and Forms

## Forms

1. **_What is a ‘Controlled Component’?_** - A form element that has its value controlled by React, making the React state the single source of truth.
2. **_Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why?_** - Since useState is asynchronous is is a good idea to update it on entry so that the state value is ready to be used on form submit.
3. **_How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?_** - `event.target.value`

## The Conditional (Ternary) Operator

1. **_Why would we use a ternary operator?_** - To shorten our code and save time to type, whilst making it neater and sometimes easier to read.
2. **_Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:_**
   `if(x===y){console.log(true);} else {console.log(false);}`
   `x===y? console.log(true) : console.log(false);`
