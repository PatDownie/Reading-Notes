# Class 05 - Design web pages with CSS

## What is CSS?

CSS stands for cascading style sheets. It is a type of code which will look at a HTML document and give certain qualities to certain sections of the code. For example CSS may look through the HTML code and look for the main header *(h1)* and give it a colour of **red**

CSS will turn a boring list of text and images into a proper website
