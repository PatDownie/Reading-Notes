# Class 06 - Activate web pages with JavaScript

If HTML is the structure of your website, and CSS is the polish that makes it look pretty, then Javascript is the electro-mechanical guts that makes it function in cool and interesting ways.   
To include or link a JavaScript file in your html, simply include the element `<script></script>`

Some examples of fun things javascript can do:  

- **Write to the console!** - You can write to the console by using the function `console.log()`. This is useful for printing debugging information.
- **Prompt the user!** - Javascript can prompt the user for a written response using `prompt()`. This can usefully set a variable value to whatever the user typed, such as their name.  

## Class questions
  
1. ***What are variables in javascript?*** - Variables are parts of the code that can be given a name and a value, allowing you to call upon them (and sometimes change them) later
    - ***Some examples:***
        - **String** - A plaintext string of typed characters, defined by `"quotation marks"`
        - **Number** - A number with a certain value, defined by being a number with no quotation marks
        - **Boolean** - A true or false value, defined by the words `true` and `false`
2. ***What does it mean to "declare" a variable?*** - To declare a varible is to bring it into existance and (usually) give it a value, there are 4 ways to do this:
    - `let` will declare a variable that can be changed later, useful when working with loops.
    - `const` will declare a variable that cannot be changed
    - `var` is an older way of declaring variables, only really useful in old code or in specific circumstances (such as when hoisting or redeclaring a variable)
    - `Nothing` You can also declare a variable without using a keyword (eg `x=42`)
3. ***What is an “assignment” operator, and what does it do?*** - An assignment operator is an equals sign `=` and is used to assign a value to a variable.
4. ***What is information received from the user called?*** - User input
