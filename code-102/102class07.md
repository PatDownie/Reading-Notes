# Class 07 - Programming with JavaScript

javascript is a powerful language that can do a whole range of cool things. using a combination of functions, and operators, one can perform complex tasks by invoking a function in a single line of code.

An operator is a symbol used to combine, interact or compare variables such as: 
- `+` add
- `/` divide
-  `&&` AND (a comparison variable)

For example, one could write:
`if (x = 6 && y = 7)`
This would check both that x is equal to 6, and also that y is equal to 7

## Class questions
  
1. ***What is control flow?*** - Control flow is the order in which the code is read and executed by the computer, usually top to bottom, but sometimes the order can be changed, for example with loops.
2. ***What is a JavaScript function?*** - A function is a piece of code that has a certain use. it is self contained and can be called (or "invoked") as many times as you like.
3. ***What does it mean to invoke - or call - a function?*** - To invoke or call a function is to "activate" it within the code, executing its task.
4. ***What are the parenthesis () for when you define a function?*** - When defining a function, the parenthesis contain parameters (listed like this: `(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3)` etc) that can be called as arguments when the function is invoked and become variables within the function.
