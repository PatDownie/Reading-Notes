# Class 08 - Operators and Loops

- **for loops** - A for loop will run until some condition becomes `false`. For example a for loop can be used to increment a certain value every time an action is performed until the value passes beyond a certain range
- **While loops** - A while loop will execute as long as a certain value is `true`. For example a while loop can be used to check if a user has inputted the correct string in a prompt box.

## Class questions

1. ***What is an expression in JavaScript?*** - An expression is a piece of code (usually using operators) that output a value
2. ***Why would we use a loop in our code?*** - A loop can be useful for many things, such as performing a certain action a set number of times, or redoing an action until a certain action happens
3. ***When does a for loop stop executing?*** - A for loop stops executing until the specified condition becomes false.
4. ***How many times will a while loop execute?*** - A while loop can execute anywhere from once up to an infinite number of times (this is usually bad). It will execute as long as it's given condition returns true.
