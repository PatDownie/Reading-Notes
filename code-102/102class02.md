## Reflection
### Text Editors
Code is essentially just text, so there are many ways one can edit it, and many programs that do so.

Some people may choose to use a basica text editor like notepad, but this maybe be more difficult as it does not contain any useful coding-specific features.

Specifically designed code editors may be a better choice, such as:

- **vscode**: A code eidtor for windows
- **Notepad++**: Another windows code editor
- **BBedit**: An editor for Mac

All of these will have useful features such as code completion and colour coding.

### IDEs

An IDE is an even more advanced piece of software that can also compile and run your code, as well as a lot of other useful features.
